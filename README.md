Name: **Grigory**

Student number: **AB0229** 

Student group: **TIC21S1**

Course code: **TTC1030-3014**

## Description 

This is a course that I took during the second semester of my first year at [Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences](https://www.jamk.fi/en) (JAMK)

## Software used

* EXOS - virtual switch 
* Vyos - virtual router 
* Lubuntu - VMs that were attached to virtual routers and switches 
* VirtualBox - was used throughout the whole course to import VMs in .ova format  and use them 
* VS code - was used throughout the whole course to create documentation in .md format 
* GitLab - initially, documentation was stored on the university's GitLab
* draw.io - was used to draw physical and logical topologies
* Wireshark - was used on the lubuntu VM to test network(s).

## Hardware used

2017 MacBook Pro  

* Intel Core i5
* 128GB SSD
* 8GB RAM

## Challenges 

* The main challenge for me was the lack of RAM on my laptop. The first few exercises went well but later on, I had to play Russian roulette every time I did an assignment. My OS crashed countless times.

* There is always a human factor, that causes most of the problems in every IT company. Personally, it happened to me but eventually, I fixed all of the issues I caused myself :)

## Time spent 

For each assignment the time that I spent varied. For the first five assignments, we had full guidance thus these were done in no time, then we were released to float freely. I must admit, that it took some time to get used to it but after a few exercises my time spent significantly decreased.

## Evaluation 

I have done 17 out of 17 exercises, passed the exam and got a 5 for the course.
