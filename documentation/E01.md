# Documentation for E01

## Goal

The goal of this assignment was to import the image of lubuntu virtual machine to the VirtualBox, connect it to the internet, and test the connectivity with the terminal commands: **ping**, **mtr**, and **traceroute** as well as answer a few general questions related to the networks.

## Mac adress of my VM

```
08002789D5B9
```
## VM's network settings

## Philosophical questions and mine no less philosophical answers 

> What is this virtual machine useful for without a network connection? What can you do with it?

**Well, it's a good question. You can do a lot with it:**

* Use text editors such as vim to write your code or just stuck there and wonder how to exit it.
* Play 2048
* Use pre-installed python 3.8 to run your programs 
* Use all stack of "Libre" programs 
* Mess with terminal
* Write notes
* Use calculator
* etc.
> Is there any point in computers without network connectivity?

**Yes, it is! Computer is still a powerful machine wich you can use without internet.** 
\
\
**You can:**

* Make .txt files
* Use vim, nano, etc
* Work in 365 office programs(windows, mac os) or in libre office in Linux
* Use calculator 
* Play games 
* Use complex soft as AutoCAD or Logisim 
* Enjoy such content as films, books and music
* Program 
* Mess up with your terminal
* Edit videos and photos 
* etc.

But you need to make sure that you installed all soft you need before using it without internet. Or if your PC doesn't have WI-FI module at all install your stuff manually using memory sticks or CDs.

There is also a point to use computers without network in terms of cyber security because if you don't have internet connection it's gona be nearly impossible to hack you remotely.
