## Philosophical questions and mine no less philosophical answers 

> What is this virtual machine useful for without a network connection? What can you do with it?


**Well, it's a good question. You can do a lot with it:**

* Use text editors such as vim to write your code or just stuck there and wonder how to exit it.
* Play 2048
* Use pre-installed python 3.8 to run your programs 
* Use all stack of "Libre" programs 
* Mess up with terminal
* Write notes
* Use calculator

> Is there any point in computers without network connectivity?


**Yes, it is! Computer is still a powerful machine wich you can use without internet.** 
\
\
**You can:**

* Make .txt files
* Use vim, nano, etc
* Work in 365 office programs(windows, mac os) or in libre office in Linux
* Use calculator 
* Play games 
* Use complex soft as AutoCAD or Logisim 
* Enjoy such content as films, books and music
* Program 
* Mess up with your terminal
* Edit videos and photos 

But you need to make sure that you installed all soft you need before using it without internet. Or if your PC doesn't have WI-FI module at all install your stuff manually using memory sticks or CDs.

There is also a point to use computers without network in terms of cyber security because if you don't have internet connection it's gona be nearly impossible to hack you remotely.
