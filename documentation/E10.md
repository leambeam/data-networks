# Documentation for E10

## Goal 

The goal of this assignment was to configure the Network address translation (NAT) specifically Many to 1 NAT within the network. After that was done, I verified the functionality of the NAT through the **show** command and **Wireshark**.  

## Configuring Many-to-1 NAT

### I decided to configure NAT without removing the firewall

```
set nat source rule 10 outbound-interface eth2
set nat source rule 10 translation address masquerade
```

```
set nat source rule 10 source address 192.168.15.0/24
```

### NAT config on **Vyos 3**

## Investigating traffic

### **`nmap` Lubuntu 1,2,3 --> Lubuntu 4**

```
root@lubuntu-virtualbox:~# nmap -D 192.168.15.2,192.168.15.65,192.168.15.130 100.24.15.2
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-04-11 15:39 EEST
Nmap scan report for 100.24.15.2
Host is up (0.0057s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT    STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http
443/tcp closed https
```


### **`show` on Vyos 3 after using `nmap`** 

```
show nat source translations
```

```
show nat destination translations 
```

### I cloned **Lubuntu 4** and turned it into the Wireshark machine

### To check if the nat configuration is working I have pinged Lubuntu 4 from Lubuntu 1 while wiresharking public and LAN1 (one at a time)

### **Lubuntu 1 --> Lubuntu 4** (Wireshark connected to LAN1)

### **Lubuntu 1 --> Lubuntu 4** (Wireshark connected to public)
